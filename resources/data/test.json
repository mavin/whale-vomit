			"content": "<p>Many teens are unaware of the dangers associated with STIs and how to prevent or identify them. Talking with your partner about STIs and getting tested regularly are important parts of being sexually active. Myths exist regarding all STIs, but especially Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) and Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS). You cannot get HIV from hugging, drinking out of a shared glass, or using a public toilet. There are three primary ways of contracting HIV:</p><ol><li>Unprotected sex with an infected individual</li><li>Sharing needles</li><li>From mother to unborn child</li>"

			"quote": "Approximately 44% of people who are victims of a sexual assault are under the age of 18. (Harborview Center for Sexual Assault and Traumatic Stress)",
			"content": "<p>Due to the violence that often accompanies a rape or sexual assault, it is important for a victim to go to the emergency department of their local hospital to be examined for injuries. At the hospital, a social worker will discuss a victim’s options, including that of evidence collection. Because of this, it is helpful if the victim does not shower, clean up or change clothes before having an exam, as doing so may remove any remaining evidence. Additionally, the doctor can discuss medications that are available to reduce the chances of contracting a sexually transmitted infection (STI) or getting pregnant. If the victim is under the age of 18, the law requires the police to be notified.</p><p>However, going to the hospital and submitting a report does not necessarily mean that charges must be filed against the perpetrator or that participation in a legal case must occur. Counselors can talk about available alternatives and help the victim decide what the best choice is going to be for the individual.</p>" 		}

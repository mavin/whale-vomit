If you think you may be pregnant, it\u2019s important to make an appointment to get tested by a health care professional as home pregnancy kits are not always accurate. In Washington State, teens 13 years and older do not need a parent\u2019s/legal guardian\u2019s permission to be tested. If you are pregnant, seek emotional support from someone you trust and talk with a medical professional about your options.</p><br />"

At the hospital, a social worker will discuss a victim's options, including that of evidence collection. Because of this, it is helpful if the victim does not shower, clean up or change clothes before having an exam, as doing so may remove any remaining evidence.</p><br /><br /><p>Additionally, the doctor can discuss medications that are available to reduce the chances of contracting a sexually transmitted infection (STI) or getting pregnant. If the victim is under the age of 18, the law requires the police to be notified. However, going to the hospital and submitting a report does not necessarily mean that charges must be filed against the perpetrator or that participation in a legal case must occur.
